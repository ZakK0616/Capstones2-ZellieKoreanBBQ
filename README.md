# Capstones2-ZellieKoreanBBQ
Description:
Zellie Korean BBQ is a Java console application that simulates a Korean BBQ restaurant ordering system. Users can create and customize orders with meats, sides, rice, and drinks. The application supports multiple meat selections, premium and regular toppings, special preparation options, and drink sizes. Orders can be viewed, modified, and removed before checkout. Upon confirmation, a timestamped receipt is generated with a full summary and total cost. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, and separation of concerns in a real-world scenario.
